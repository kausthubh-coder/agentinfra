        self.memory = None
        self.environment = None
        self.sub_agents = []

    def perceive(self, input_data):
        """Process input data from the environment or other agents."""
        pass

    def decide(self):
        """Make decisions based on perceptions and memory."""
        pass

    def act(self):
        """Perform actions or communicate with other agents."""
        pass

    def run(self):
        """Main loop for agent execution."""
        pass
```

**Sample Code**:

```python:memory/long_term_memory.py
class LongTermMemory:
    def __init__(self):
        self.memory_store = VectorDatabase()

    def store(self, data):
        embedding = generate_embedding(data)
        self.memory_store.add(embedding, data)

    def retrieve(self, query):
        embedding = generate_embedding(query)
        return self.memory_store.search(embedding)
```

```python:tools/file_system_tool.py
class FileSystemTool:
    def read_file(self, path):
        with open(path, 'r') as file:
            return file.read()

    def write_file(self, path, content):
        with open(path, 'w') as file:

**Sample Code**:

```python:models/model_manager.py
class ModelManager:
    def __init__(self, models):
        self.models = models  # Dictionary of model instances

    def get_model(self, model_name):
        return self.models.get(model_name)
```

---

## Workflow and Execution

AgentInfra supports complex workflows involving multiple agents working collaboratively. Agents can delegate tasks to sub-agents, communicate results, and handle failures through feedback loops.

**Example Workflow**:

1. **Codex Agent (PlannerAgent)**:

   - Receives an idea from the user.
   - Interacts to refine the idea and gather requirements.
   - Generates detailed specifications and creates a `spec.md` file.
   - Delegates tasks to `FrontendEngineer` and `BackendEngineer`.

2. **FrontendEngineer (EngineerAgent)**:

   - Plans tasks based on specifications.
   - Creates tests for each task.
   - Delegates tasks to `MicroAgents`.
   - Validates results and handles any failures or retries.
   - Runs integration tests on the completed frontend.

3. **MicroAgents**:

   - Receive individual tasks.
   - Generate code and run unit tests.
   - Retry up to a set limit if tests fail.
   - Report back to `FrontendEngineer`.

4. **BackendEngineer (EngineerAgent)**:

   - Similar workflow to `FrontendEngineer`, focusing on backend tasks with Supabase.

5. **QAAgent**:
   - Performs UI tests using tools like `BrowserTestingTool`.
   - Reviews code for vulnerabilities and adherence to best practices.
